Approach	        Linear and sequential                                     	Iterative and incremental
Flexibility	      Low (hard to change requirements once defined)	            High (adaptable to changing requirements)
Testing   	      Done after development phase	                              Continuous testing throughout iterations
Documentation   	Comprehensive and detailed	                                Less formal, focuses on working software
Predictability	  More predictable in terms of timelines and costs	          Less predictable, as requirements and priorities can change
Feedback	        Limited to end of phases	                                  Frequent and ongoing feedback
Risk Management 	Risks are harder to address once phases are complete	      Risks are managed continuously with iterative adjustments
Project Management	Easier to manage with clear milestones	                  Requires strong team collaboration and adaptive management

Agile 
Advantages:
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows for changes in requirements and scope throughout the development process, making it easier to adapt to new information or evolving client needs.
Continuous Feedback: Regular iterations and reviews provide frequent opportunities for stakeholder feedback, which helps ensure the product meets user needs.
Improved Collaboration: Agile promotes close collaboration between development teams, stakeholders, and clients, fostering better communication and alignment.
Disadvantages:
Less Predictability: Agile’s flexible nature can make it harder to predict timelines and budgets, as requirements and priorities can shift.
Documentation: Agile may involve less formal documentation, which can lead to potential gaps in project records or understanding.
Scope Creep: Frequent changes and continuous iterations can lead to scope creep if not managed carefully.
Requires Experienced Teams: Agile requires experienced teams and stakeholders who can effectively manage iterative processes and frequent changes.

Waterfall 
Advantages:
Structured Approach: The clear, sequential stages make it easy to understand and manage the project.
Predictable Timelines: With a fixed plan, timelines and budgets are easier to estimate and predict.
Documented Requirements: Detailed documentation at each stage helps ensure that requirements are clearly defined and agreed upon before development begins.
Easy to Manage: The structured nature simplifies project management, as progress is linear and milestones are well-defined.
Disadvantages:
Inflexibility: Changes to requirements or scope are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is complete.
Late Testing: Testing is typically done after the development phase, which can lead to discovering issues late in the project lifecycle.
Risk of Misalignment: If requirements change or are not well-understood initially, the final product may not meet the user’s needs.
Slow to Adapt: The linear approach does not accommodate iterative feedback or changes well, which can lead to a less responsive development process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is beneficial for projects with high uncertainty, evolving requirements, frequent feedback needs, and where rapid delivery is important. Examples include mobile app development, e-commerce platforms, and research projects.
